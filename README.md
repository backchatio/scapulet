  Scapulet 
  
Scapulet is an XMPP component library that currently supports XEP-0114 (http://xmpp.org/extensions/xep-0114.html).  
It uses the standard scala library for parsing xml so you can match against it using the xml snippets.
It uses akka for concurrency and fault-tolerance.

The main motivation for writing this was that all libraries I used so far only work well if you want to write a bot, or
don't work with all jabber clients etc. Most of them also insist on writing their own xml parser where IMO that's not
the place where most of the time is spent.

== Note on Patches/Pull Requests
 
* Fork the project.
* Make your feature addition or bug fix.
* Add tests for it. This is important so I don't break it in a
  future version unintentionally.
* Commit, do not mess with sbt project, version, or history.
  (if you want to have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself I can ignore when I pull)
* Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
